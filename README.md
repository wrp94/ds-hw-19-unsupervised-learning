Homework for Module 19 - Unsupervised Learning

## Summary

In this assignment, I used K-Means to cluster crypto currencies. All analysis and visualizations are provided in [this](CryptoClustering/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb) notebook. Future work should include using different modeling techniques like Agglomerative Clustering and Random Forest on a larger sample of data.
